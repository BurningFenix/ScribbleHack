JC Answers:

I'm not entirely so sure of what you are asking, but I am planning to setup a meeting between us so we answer all of 
these questions. Also my job will be to include the html/css/jquery stuff working properly with ur scripts and
teach the designers of how they can modify/add things themselves in the future and also how to install new apps with pip 
since everytime we have something new then they also need to be aware of it.
